# Using Claude as your project manager

One page, made for a phone. Every number has its source; "not measured yet" means nobody has.

## Start a project

Once per new claude.ai project, before the first message. The project chat loads no repo, so
the rules reach it only through this text. A global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` from `cloud/setup.sh`
does not help: the project chat runs in a fixed environment without your setup script (checked
2026-10-08: no setup plugins, its own environment id), and threads already get the rules from
this text and the repo.

1. Open [`operator/templates/project-instructions.md`](../.claude/skills/operator/templates/project-instructions.md)
   and copy everything below the `---` line.
2. In the project: **Project settings > Memory > Project instructions**, paste, replace `<app>`
   with one line on what the project is, save.
3. **Project settings > Repositories**: add `yverse-studio/claude-setup` (threads load the
   details from it).

When a rule changes, the template changes in the same PR; paste it again into running projects.

## Start an app

Write **one message** in the Company XY project, as short as you like: what it is, who it is for,
and what you would charge, if anything. Or tap the notepad in HQ. That is all. You do not name
files, tools or models.

## What happens next

1. **Brainstorm.** Claude says what it would build instead, pushes back with reasons, then sends
   one batch of tap cards. Answer once.
2. **Research, plan.** Market, prices, law, tools. Result: `PLAN.md` and the acceptance criteria.
3. **Brief (a): ok or no.** The first thing you get. Nothing to set up: Claude makes the repo,
   the Worker and the first deploy itself (below).
4. **Build.** One thread per slice. Every change is a PR that a separate gate thread checks
   (CI, a live test of the preview, a fresh review, security, design and law). At 5/5 it **merges
   itself**, and the thread says `Done: <what changed>`.
5. **Launch and after.** The loop reads errors and feedback every day (`docs/LOOP.md`).

You read only the project chat: the coordinator posts every result, `Done:` line and card there
(rule in `CLAUDE.md`, How to work); PR links and gate talk stay in the threads, and you open a
thread only when something is wrong. Plus the HQ rows (`docs/hq-rows.md`). Cards show options
with one recommended; work continues on it unless it is money, a new service or a deletion.

## Deploy a page in one shot

What you do: write the idea. A thread does the rest.

1. Pick the name: lowercase letters, digits, dashes. It is the repo and the Worker name.
2. Start `new-project.yml` in `yverse-studio/claude-setup`: GitHub MCP `actions_run_trigger`
   `run_workflow`, ref `main`, inputs `name` and `d1` (false when the page stores no data). Or
   push branch `new/<name>` with one file `projects/<name>.json`:
   `{ "name": "<name>", "d1": true, "org": "yverse-studio" }`.
3. Register it: `projects/<name>.json` lands on claude-setup's `main` in a small PR (for an
   existing org repo the file also names `"repo"`). Delete refuses names without it.
4. Wait for the run (`actions_list` `list_workflow_runs`, then `actions_get`). Its summary has
   the repo, `https://<name>.yverse.workers.dev` and the first build's status.
5. `add_repo` the new repo, then build on branches: every branch gets a Preview, every merge to
   `main` goes live. Post the live link.

Detail and failures: `publish` skill (A new project).

## Delete a page

What you do: say "delete <name>". Deleting is the one step Claude asks for first.

1. Run `delete-project.yml` (`actions_run_trigger` `run_workflow`, ref `main`) with `name`,
   `confirm` = the name again, `dry_run` true. Read the plan in the log.
2. Run it again with `dry_run` false. It removes the Worker and its builds, D1 `<name>` and
   `<name>-preview`, the repo and a leftover `new/<name>` branch.
3. Remove `projects/<name>.json` from `main` in a small PR, and say it is gone.

It refuses protected names, names without `projects/<name>.json` on `main`, and repos the
workflow did not make. Detail: `publish` skill (Delete a project).

## When Claude asks you

Only for real money, mail or posts, deleting data, force-push, rotating a secret, a choice with
no clear default, design input, or a step only you can do. The full list: `CLAUDE.md` (How to
work). Everything else it just does and tells you.

You get a notification only when needed, plus big milestones.
Say "stop" or "pause" and everything stops; a look you reject stays rejected.

## What stays with you, and why

| Step | Why Claude can't |
|---|---|
| Delete a branch, re-run Actions, CLAUDE.md edits | Cloud threads get a 403 on branch deletes and Actions re-runs, and the safety check may refuse edits to policy files (CLAUDE.md, gate.md) and refuses secret reads; a PC session deletes branches; a refused policy edit needs your Allow in that thread |
| Keys and tokens | They live in claude-setup's GitHub Actions and the Worker, never in chat |
| Real money: Stripe live, ads, Gewerbe, domain | Legal and money steps need your name and hands |
| Owner settings of your accounts (who gets access, app installs, billing) and passwords | Claude never types a password or solves a CAPTCHA; it works in Cloudflare and GitHub through its own member logins (`docs/pc-claude-user.md`, decided 2026-10-08) |
| The laptop | It must be on; Remote Control only runs while it is |

## What it costs

| Item | Number | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Claude itself | your Max plan (about 90 €/month); no per-message euros. When the usage window fills, threads wait and resume by themselves | memory, 2026-10-07 |
| API calls (the laptop worker's Haiku) | billed apart from the plan; set a monthly limit | `yverse-studio/worker` PR 4 |
| Always loaded in a session | ~6k tokens from this repo | STRUCTURE.md |
| A project thread starts at | ~110k tokens, ~104k of it harness and memory outside this repo | STRUCTURE.md |
| Hand-off | warns at 150k, hand off by 200k | `global/context-guard.mjs` |
| Hosting, all apps together | Cloudflare 0 to 4,35 €/month, even at 10,000 users | research/hosting.md |
| The daily loop check | no euros: one short turn on the plan | not measured in tokens yet |
| Example of waste | fanning out several threads before anything was visible cost about 10 € of tokens in test run 1 | operator `SKILL.md` |
| Cost per finished app | not measured yet | |

Keep it cheap: one app at a time, at most three working threads, ask for a first visible result
before more.
