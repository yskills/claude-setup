# Map: where everything lives and what it owes

One page to find any part of this setup. Each rule has **one home**; every other file links to
that home instead of restating it. When two files disagree, the home wins and the other gets
fixed.

## What loads when

| Loads | What | Cost (tokens, est.) |
|---|---|---|
| Every session | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/ecc/common/*`, one line per skill and agent | ~6k |
| When a matching file is opened | `.claude/rules/ecc/{typescript,vue,nuxt,web}/*` (`paths:` frontmatter) | up to ~9k |
| When a skill is used | its `SKILL.md`, then the files it links | 0.5k to 6k per skill |
| When an agent is started | its `.claude/agents/<name>.md`, in its own context | 1k to 2k |
| Only when a file says to read it | `docs/*`, operator `roles/`, `gate.md`, `briefs.md`, templates | 0 until read |

A project thread's own base (system prompt, tools, project instructions, memory) is ~110k and
lives outside this repo.

## Parts

| Part | Path | Owes |
|---|---|---|
| Working rules | `CLAUDE.md` | How Claude works for yskills: ask rule, co-founder, merge, models, UI, stack. Short; detail lives in the homes below |
| Front door | `README.md` | Install, what you get, cloud setup, how to change the repo |
| This map | `docs/MAP.md` | Where things live, one home per rule |
| Run a project | `.claude/skills/operator/` | `SKILL.md` size, roles, files, setup loop, cost; `run.md` the nine steps (Project Manager only); `gate.md` the 5/5 gate and the one merge policy; `briefs.md` the three briefs, key cards and the block every thread brief starts with; `roles/<role>.md` one playbook per role; `templates/` files copied into a project (`loop/` the feedback inbox, `mailbox/` Claude's own e-mail inbox Worker) |
| Roadmap for yskills | `docs/WORKFLOW.md` | The phases in plain words, the models table, learning and memory check |
| Other own skills | `.claude/skills/<name>/` | `legal`, `sell`, `market`, `store`, `publish`, `scaffold`, `onboard-project`, `ship-check`, `ui-review`, `toolbox`, `game-3d`, `watch` |
| Vendored skills, agents, rules | `.claude/skills`, `.claude/agents`, `.claude/rules/ecc` | ECC subset (`config/ecc.json`, refreshed by `scripts/sync-ecc.mjs`), impeccable, web-interface-guidelines, ponytail, claude-video (`THIRD_PARTY.md`); never hand-edited |
| Own agents | `.claude/agents/` | `design-critic`, `evaluator`, `legal-reviewer`, `red-team` |
| PC install | `install.mjs`, `global/`, `config/plugins.json`, `mods/team` | Copies this repo into `~/.claude`, settings, status line, context guard, plugins, the team mod |
| Claude's PC user | `docs/pc-claude-user.md` | What differs on the `Claude` Windows user (portable Git, env var, paths) and what still needs hands |
| Cloud threads | `cloud/setup.sh` | Plugins and the context guard in a cloud environment (paste into Project settings) |
| HQ rows | `docs/hq-rows.md` | What each Project Manager writes into HQ (the page itself lives in yverse-studio/company-xy) |
| Using it (for yskills) | `docs/USING.md` | One phone page: how to start an app, what you see, when Claude asks, what it costs |
| After launch | `docs/LOOP.md` | Errors and feedback become issues and fix threads |
| Setup loop | operator `SKILL.md` (Setup loop) | Friction with this repo becomes a `loop:setup` issue, then a fix thread through the gate |
| Test runs | `docs/TEST-PROJECTS.md` | How the setup is tested end to end, and what each run taught |
| Why it is built this way | `docs/RESEARCH.md`, `docs/research/` | Dated research notes; history, not rules |
| Checks | `scripts/check.mjs`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Frontmatter, names, models, ECC subset, plugin lists, relative links |

## One home per rule

| Rule | Home | Others only link |
|---|---|---|
| Ask rule (what needs yskills) | `CLAUDE.md` (How to work) | operator `SKILL.md`, project instructions |
| Co-founder | `CLAUDE.md` (How to work) | `roles/*.md` (one role-specific line each) |
| Literal mode and cost | the brief block in `briefs.md` | `roles/*.md` (one pointer each) |
| Merge policy, 5/5 gate | `gate.md` (Merge policy) | `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/WORKFLOW.md`, `roles/tester.md` |
| Models | the one line in `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (Models); project instructions carry it word for word | everything else links it; CI fails on a second wording or on the old model name |
| Context guard numbers (warn 150k, hand off 200k) | `global/context-guard.mjs` | `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` |
| Remote Control on the PC | `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (PC work) | project instructions template |
| UI rules | `CLAUDE.md` (UI) | `roles/designer.md`, `ui-review` (screenshots, the load-once check, run videos via `desktop.sh`) |
| Deploys | `publish` skill | `CLAUDE.md` (stack) |
| Money and shop law | `sell` skill | `docs/WORKFLOW.md` (Selling) |
| Project instructions text | `operator/templates/project-instructions.md` | the live text in each project's settings |
| Reply style, say done, notify, talk first, honesty, hand-off at 200k | `operator/templates/project-instructions.md` | the live text in each project's settings |

## Keeping it clean

- A new rule goes into its home and nowhere else; add a row above if it has no home yet.
- A dated quote from yskills goes into the home once; other files point to it.
- `node scripts/check.mjs` fails on a dead relative link.
- Research and test-run notes are history: never cite them as the rule.
