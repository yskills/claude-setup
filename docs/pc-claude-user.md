# The `Claude` Windows user on MeinLaptop

Claude's own home on yskills' laptop since 2026-10-08: a standard (non-admin) Windows user named
`Claude`, home `C:\Users\Claude`. Remote Control sessions for project work run here. Everything
in `install.mjs` works as on yskills' own user (`C:\Users\Ich`); this page lists only what differs.

## What is different

| Item | On this user | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Git | Portable Git in `C:\Users\Claude\Git` (PortableGit 2.55.0.5), `C:\Users\Claude\Git\cmd` on the **user** PATH | `winget install Git.Git` elevates and fails with exit code 4 on a standard user |
| Git Bash for Claude Code | user env `CLAUDE_CODE_GIT_BASH_PATH=C:\Users\Claude\Git\bin\bash.exe` | Claude Code needs Git Bash; the portable one is not where it looks by default |
| Claude Code | `C:\Users\Claude\.local\bin\claude.exe`, folder on the user PATH | native installer puts it there; PATH entry added by hand |
| claude-setup clone | `C:\Users\Claude\claude-setup` | same as `C:\Users\Ich\claude-setup` on yskills' user |
| Node, gh, Chrome | winget, machine-wide (`C:\Program Files\...`) | installed with yskills at the laptop |
| Python 3.13, ffmpeg, uv, fnm | winget `--scope user` (all in `%LOCALAPPDATA%`) | the tools `install.mjs` reports as missing |
| pwsh 7 | Microsoft Store package via `winget install --id 9MZ1SNWT0N5D --source msstore` | the MSI needs admin; `live-shot.ps1` needs pwsh |
| Blender | 5.1, machine-wide (`C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation`); Blender Lab MCP add-on 1.0.3 with Auto Start, server `Blender` in `~/.claude.json` (`studio` skill) | shared with yskills' user; add-on and server are per user |
| GitHub | `gh` logged in as `yskills-claude`; commits are authored as `Claude <339700673+yskills-claude@users.noreply.github.com>` | Claude's own account; Write on claude-setup (tested 2026-10-08), the other repos once yskills adds it |
| Claude in Chrome | extension installed in this user's Chrome profile | untested: a session only has the tools it started with, so the first fresh session there tests it with a screenshot |
| Roblox Studio | not installed | installs per user and needs a Roblox login Claude does not have yet |
| Environment variables | always set for the user, never machine-wide; no admin | standard user |

A shell started before a PATH change does not see it, and Remote Control sessions inherit the
PATH of the process that hosts them. After installs, restart that host (not just the session).

## What still needs yskills' hands

- **Remote Control host restart:** the running `claude remote-control` still has the PATH from
  before the installs. In a fresh terminal on this user: `cd C:\Users\Claude\Documents\GitHub`,
  then `C:\Users\Claude\.local\bin\claude.exe remote-control`.
- **One folder approval, once per claude.ai project:** every repo is cloned under
  `C:\Users\Claude\Documents\GitHub`, so approving that one folder in the project's settings
  (Resources > Devices) covers every current and future project there; nothing is needed per
  repo. A thread cannot approve it itself (it is yskills' consent), so a new claude.ai project
  asks once, on its first Remote Control start, and never again.
- **Repo access:** `yskills-claude` gets Write on each repo at
  `https://github.com/yverse-studio/<repo>/settings/access`.
- **Mail and Cloudflare:** the Gmail connector signed in as Claude's Gmail
  (claude.ai/settings/connectors), and a Cloudflare member invite (Administrator) to that Gmail.
- **context7:** the plugin's MCP server asks for authentication once (`/mcp` in an interactive
  session).
- **Roblox Studio:** later, once Claude has a Roblox login.
