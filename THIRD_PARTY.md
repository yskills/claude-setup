## Ponytail

Source: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail (MIT, see .claude/skills/ponytail/LICENSE)
Version: 4.10.3
Commit: c982cd411abb53323c4baa1baa3c2f020b8d0b08

Only the core skill is copied, unchanged: .claude/skills/ponytail/SKILL.md. Its hooks (which
re-inject the skill on every session start and subagent) and its five extra skills are left
out. Read in full before adding; it runs nothing and makes no network calls.

## Impeccable

Source: https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable (Apache-2.0, see licenses/IMPECCABLE-LICENSE)
Version: skill 4.5.0
Commit: 6e802bd

Copied unchanged into .claude/skills/impeccable. Read before adding: the skill is instructions
plus reference files; `scripts/impeccable detect` downloads the engine binary from the project's
GitHub releases and checks its sha256 before running it. It sends no code anywhere.

## Vercel Web Interface Guidelines

Source: https://github.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines (MIT, see
licenses/WEB-INTERFACE-GUIDELINES-LICENSE)
Commit: e3d624b

The guideline text is pinned in .claude/skills/web-interface-guidelines/SKILL.md instead of
fetched live, so a review never needs a web read.

## claude-video (watch)

Source: https://github.com/bradautomates/claude-video (MIT, see licenses/CLAUDE-VIDEO-LICENSE)
Version: 0.3.2
Commit: 03ceb42

Copied into .claude/skills/watch: SKILL.md and scripts/, minus the packaging script
build-skill.sh. The plugin's SessionStart hook (a setup check) is left out. Two local changes,
from a security review: keys are never read from the current project's `.env`
(`scripts/config.py`), and yt-dlp runs from a fresh private directory so a repo's `yt-dlp.conf` can't
add options (`scripts/download.py`). Read in full before
adding: standard-library Python that runs yt-dlp and ffmpeg. It talks only to the video site,
and to Gemini, Groq or OpenAI when a key for one is set in the environment or
~/.config/watch/.env. Optional WhisperX setup downloads uv and
PyTorch.

The pieces HQ's desk room uses are packed into `.claude/skills/operator/templates/office-kit.js`

## Kenney Cube Pets

Source: https://kenney.nl/assets/cube-pets (CC0 1.0, no attribution required)

The nine animals of HQ's team office and their colormap are packed into
`.claude/skills/operator/templates/pets-kit.js` by `scripts/pets-kit.mjs`. Do not edit the packed file;
change the script's list and re-run it.
