# claude-setup

yskills' global Claude Code setup: one command makes every project on a machine use the same
rules, skills, agents, hooks and plugins. Built on
[Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/ECC) (the Anthropic hackathon winner's
setup), curated to this stack so it costs about a fifth of the context the full version does.

Lost? [`docs/MAP.md`](docs/MAP.md) says where every part lives, what loads when, and which file
is the one home of each rule.

## Install

Needs Node 20+ (24 recommended), Git and Claude Code.

Windows (PowerShell; use `$HOME`, never `~`, which PowerShell passes through as a folder named "~"):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/yskills/claude-setup $HOME/claude-setup
node $HOME/claude-setup/install.mjs
```

Mac or Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yskills/claude-setup ~/claude-setup && node ~/claude-setup/install.mjs
```

Update later (Windows: run the two commands one after the other, with `$HOME` instead of `~`):

```bash
git -C ~/claude-setup pull && node ~/claude-setup/install.mjs
```

Re-running is safe. Your old `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `settings.json` are backed up to
`~/.claude/backups/` each time; your own notes in `CLAUDE.md` outside the managed block, your
own skills and agents, and settings keys this setup doesn't touch are kept.
Flags: `--dry-run`, `--skip-plugins`, `--skip-hooks`. At the end it lists useful command-line
tools that are missing (gh, ffmpeg, docker, python, uv, fnm) with the install command for your OS.

## What you get

| Piece | What | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | How Claude works for you: owns tasks end to end, verifies before pushing, screenshot-reviews UI, your default stack | `CLAUDE.md` |
| Settings | Auto permission mode, safe allow list, asks before force-push and deploys, denies reading `.env` and key files (a deny rule is not a sandbox), high effort, status line with context bar | `global/settings.json` |
| 13 plugins on | superpowers, frontend-design, security-guidance, TypeScript and Python LSP, Context7, Playwright, commit-commands, code-simplifier, feature-dev, claude-md-management, claude-code-setup, skill-creator (`/code-review` and the `claude-api` skill are built into Claude Code now) | Anthropic's official marketplace, `config/plugins.json` |
| 7 plugins per project | Cloudflare, Firebase, Stripe, Sentry, PostHog, Supabase, Vercel: installed but off; a repo turns one on in its `.claude/settings.json` | same |
| 17 ECC skills | Vue, Nuxt 4, Vite, API design, security review, e2e, SEO, i18n... | `.claude/skills`, list in `config/ecc.json` |
| 15 ECC agents | planner, architect, code/TS/Vue/security/database reviewers, build-error-resolver, e2e-runner, a11y, performance, SEO... | `.claude/agents` |
| ECC rules | common + TypeScript, Vue, Nuxt, web (language rules load only for matching files) | `.claude/rules/ecc` |
| ECC hooks | session memory across restarts, quality gate after edits, design-quality warning, console.log and secret checks before commits, compaction hints (PC only) | `npx ecc-universal@2.2.3` |
| Toolbox | Knows which plugins, APIs and skills any kind of app needs (video, AI, payments, ads, auth, email, analytics, mobile, scraping...), searches all ~315 plugins, 293 ECC skills and skills.sh live (and points cloud threads at the Anthropic Directory), and adds them to that one project | `.claude/skills/toolbox` |
| Own skills | `operator` (idea to live app: sizes the job, staffs research/legal/design/build/QA/red team/launch/marketing, acceptance criteria before building, a 5/5 gate on every PR, three ok/no briefs, the gate merges every 5/5 PR), `legal` (German law for any app, privacy scan of a preview, license and trademark checks), `onboard-project` (set a repo up for Claude in one PR), `scaffold` (the exact file list of a new project's skeleton, in order), `publish` (deploys through Cloudflare Workers Builds with a preview per branch, no keys in GitHub), `ship-check` (run CI locally, then fresh `code-reviewer` passes until clean), `ui-review` (phone/desktop screenshots + critique), `sell` (checkout, shop and shipping from Germany: keys, tested Stripe-on-Workers code, German shop law, go-live), `market` (marketing plan in the PRD, launch, channels, German advertising law, weekly report), `store` (App Store and Google Play: Capacitor, RevenueCat, paywall defaults, review rules, keyless native builds), `watch` (watch a video or reel: frames plus transcript; vendored from claude-video, MIT), `game-3d` (a 3D game with three.js and Electron for Steam: folder layout, VRM characters and moves, asset licences checked, cloud screenshots and perf budget, Steam checklist) | `.claude/skills` |
| Own agents | `design-critic` (reviews screenshots for the "looks AI" problem), `evaluator` (clicks through a preview and grades a slice against its criteria), `legal-reviewer` (German must-haves on a preview), `red-team` (attacks your own preview like an outsider) | `.claude/agents` |
| Design taste | `impeccable` (design skill plus a local `detect` linter for AI-look patterns) and `web-interface-guidelines` (Vercel's UI checklist); `ui-review` runs both | `.claude/skills` (Apache-2.0 and MIT, see `THIRD_PARTY.md`) |
| Context guard | A hook after every tool call: at 150k tokens of context it tells Claude to work leaner, at 200k to wrap up and hand off, then again every further 50k (re-reading long contexts is most of the bill). Runs on the PC and in cloud threads | `global/context-guard.mjs`, `cloud/setup.sh` |
| `team` mod | Your digital team inside Claude Code (terminal or desktop app, not cloud threads): a band above the prompt shows which roles are working (the nine roles: Project Manager, Researcher, Designer, Programmer, Tester, Reviewer, Security, Legal, Marketer) and what the last turn cost; `/team` opens a pane with each role's task and a Watch link to the dev server or page being tested. Claude's test browser (Playwright) opens as a visible Chrome window on the PC | `mods/team` |
| HQ dashboard | One live page for all projects (Company XY, https://claude.ai/artifact/TmQ7UpL6EPjXKkpR9S4kJT): level, money, what needs you, who works on what with whom, progress per part, Watch links. Each project's Project Manager writes its rows into it; no project has a page of its own | [`docs/hq-rows.md`](docs/hq-rows.md) (the page lives in yskills/company-xy) |
| Ponytail | Write the least code that works: reuse, standard library, platform, installed dependency, one line, then new code | `.claude/skills/ponytail` (MIT, see `THIRD_PARTY.md`) |


## Project threads (cloud)

Threads in a Claude project run in the cloud, not on your machine. Add this repo to the
project (Project settings, Repositories) and every thread loads `CLAUDE.md` and all skills,
agents and rules from `.claude/`, the same files the installer copies.

Per project, once: install the Claude GitHub App on
[all repositories](https://github.com/apps/claude/installations/select_target) so new project
repos are reachable, then in Project settings set **Thread model** Sonnet and **Thread effort** medium
(the default is Opus at high effort), and paste
[`operator/templates/project-instructions.md`](.claude/skills/operator/templates/project-instructions.md)
into Project instructions.

Plugins and network need a [cloud environment](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cloud-environments)
(Project settings > Cloud environment > Add cloud environment). Pick the same one in every
project that uses this setup.

- **Setup script:** paste [`cloud/setup.sh`](cloud/setup.sh). It installs 11 of the 13 global
  plugins at user scope (Context7 and skill-creator stay on the PC: Context7 asks for a sign-in a
  thread can't do, and threads have Anthropic's skill-creator built in) and makes built-in
  subagents default to Sonnet. The result is cached and rebuilt about weekly, so threads don't
  pay for it each time. Plugin tools connect a few seconds after a thread starts.
- **Network access:** Custom, tick "Also include default list of common package managers", and
  add:
  - `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `unpkg.com` (CDN scripts, e.g. GSAP for HyperFrames)
  - `*.yskills.workers.dev` (your own live sites and branch previews, so threads can open and
    screenshot what they deployed; blocked otherwise)
  - `*.youtube.com`, `*.googlevideo.com`, only if threads work on video
- **No deploy keys here.** Cloudflare Workers Builds deploys `main` and gives every other branch
  its own preview (the `publish` skill); GitHub only runs `verify` and holds no keys. Threads never
  deploy themselves: `wrangler deploy` through the cloud proxy fails, because the proxy replaces
  Workers' asset-upload token (401). Optional: a Stripe *test* key as an API credential
  for `api.stripe.com` (Pro/Max plans); the proxy adds it and Claude never sees it.

On your PC, `global/settings.json` lets Claude read the official docs of your stack (Nuxt, Vue,
Cloudflare, Stripe, GitHub, MDN, German law texts...) without asking each time. Cloud threads
don't get these settings (the setup script installs plugins and one env key, not the permission
list), so there a link nobody posted in the chat still asks before it opens; whether adding the
list to the setup script would stop that is untested. Threads research with WebSearch instead.

## Using it

- **New idea:** just describe it. The `operator` skill sizes it, researches, plans and builds it, and sends you three ok/no briefs, and the gate merges every PR at 5/5; `toolbox` adds the tools to that project only.
- **New to a repo:** "onboard this project" runs `onboard-project`: a short `CLAUDE.md`,
  `.claude/settings.json` with the right per-project plugins, and a `verify` skill matching CI.
- **Before every push:** Claude runs `ship-check` on its own; ask for it any time.
- **UI work:** `ui-review` takes the screenshots, `design-critic` lists what to fix.
- **Your own Chrome:** start Claude Code with `claude --chrome` (needs the Claude in Chrome
  extension) when a page needs your login; Playwright covers everything headless.
- **Bigger features:** superpowers' brainstorm and plan skills, or `/feature-dev`.

## Changing it

- Rules for how Claude works: edit `CLAUDE.md`.
- Plugins: edit `config/plugins.json` (move one between `global` and `project`).
- ECC subset: edit `config/ecc.json`, check out that ECC version, run
  `node scripts/sync-ecc.mjs <ECC checkout>`.
- `node scripts/check.mjs` validates everything; CI runs it plus a full install into a
  throwaway home directory.
