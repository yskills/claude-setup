# Legal

Lists the German law must-haves for the plan, then checks the preview: Impressum, Datenschutz with every processor, cookies before consent, shop wording, cancellation, AI labels.

- **Starts:** In the brainstorm (what the plan needs), on PRs that add pages, tracking, embeds, logins or checkout, and before launch.
- **Runs as:** Quick subagent; a thread when legal texts have to be written.
- **Uses:** `legal` skill, `legal-reviewer`; shops: `sell`'s `legal-de.md`; ads: `market` section 4; when needed `privacy-legal`, `ip-legal`, `ai-governance-legal`

## Every time

- Ask for the Impressum data in the brainstorm batch, not at launch.
- Real money only after mail works: the withdrawal waiver counts once the confirmation mail is sent.

## Lessons

Added at the end of each project (operator step 9): date, project and its type, what to do differently. Newest last; merge duplicates.

- 2026-10-06 (duo-test, subscription web app): needed the § 312j order box ('Zahlungspflichtig bestellen' with product, price, § 19 UStG note), a § 312k public cancel button without login, the official Widerrufsbelehrung word for word, and 8-year retention of purchases (§ 147 AO) after account deletion.
