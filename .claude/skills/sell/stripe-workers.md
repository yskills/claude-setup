# Stripe on Cloudflare Workers

## Verified

The templates in `templates/` were checked on 2026-10-03:

- They ran in a minimal Nuxt 4 app (`nitro` preset `cloudflare_module`) with `stripe@23.0.0`
  (API `2026-09-30.endive`) and `zod@4`.
- `nuxt typecheck` and `nuxt build` both passed.
- The 9 tests in `templates/tests/shop.spec.ts` passed against `wrangler dev` with a local D1.
  Two of them create real Checkout Sessions against
  [stripe-mock](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-mock), Stripe's official mock, which rejects
  any parameter its API spec does not know.
- A security review covered:
  - binding each order to its session;
  - fulfilment retries;
  - weight limits;
  - deploy webhook handling;
  - key scope.

  Its fixes are in.
- stripe-mock checks parameter names, not every business rule. The first sandbox checkout with
  a real test key is the final check (SKILL.md, go-live).

The digital-product variant below ran green in yskills/duo-test.

## The flow

1. **Our order page.** It shows the cart, address, email, shipping rate, delivery time, total
   and the AGB and Widerruf links.
2. The buyer presses **"Zahlungspflichtig bestellen"**, which calls `POST /api/checkout`. That
   endpoint:
   - prices the order on the server;
   - writes it to D1 as `pending`;
   - creates a Checkout Session on the Stripe-hosted page and returns its URL.
3. **The buyer pays on Stripe's page.**
4. **We learn about the payment twice, both through `markOrderPaid`.** It flips the order
   exactly once, and only for the Checkout Session the order was created with:
   - the webhook `POST /api/stripe/webhook`;
   - the return page `/danke?session=cs_…`, which calls `POST /api/checkout/confirm`.
5. **Whichever call flips it runs `fulfilOrder`** with `waitUntil`: the confirmation email with
   the legal PDFs attached and, for physical goods, the Sendcloud order.
   - `fulfilled_at` is set only when all of that worked.
   - The admin view lists paid orders without it and has a button that runs `fulfilOrder`
     again. The email carries an idempotency key, so a retry never sends it twice.

**Why the button is on our page:** German law wants the order button to say "zahlungspflichtig
bestellen" or something just as clear (§ 312j BGB). Stripe's hosted button can only say "Pay"
("Bezahlen"), and courts have rejected similar wording. So the contract is made on our page and
Stripe only takes the money. Stripe.js never loads on our pages either.

## Templates

| Template | Goes to | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `shared/shop.ts` | `shared/` | Products, prices in cents, shipping countries and rates, Kleinunternehmer switch |
| `server/utils/env.ts` | `server/utils/` | Typed Worker env (merge with an existing one); `siteUrl` from the `SITE_URL` var |
| `server/utils/stripe.ts` | `server/utils/` | `useStripe` (fetch client; `STRIPE_API_BASE` points it at stripe-mock in tests), `readStripeEvent` (raw body + SubtleCrypto signature check) |
| `server/utils/orders.ts` | `server/utils/` | `createPendingOrder` (also deletes unpaid orders after 30 days), `attachSession`, `markOrderPaid` (idempotent, session-bound, logs money for closed orders), `setOrderStatus`, `markFulfilled` |
| `server/utils/fulfil.ts` | `server/utils/` | Confirmation email via Resend with AGB, Widerrufsbelehrung and Muster-Widerrufsformular attached. Add the Sendcloud call here (`physical.md`) |
| `server/api/checkout/index.post.ts` | same | The order button's endpoint |
| `server/api/checkout/confirm.post.ts` | same | Return page check |
| `server/api/stripe/webhook.post.ts` | same | Paid, SEPA, failed, expired, refunded, disputed |
| `server/migrations/0001_orders.sql` | the D1 `migrations_dir` | `orders` table |
| `scripts/deploy.mjs` | `scripts/` | Token check (`--check`: can it create a Worker, not just read), D1, migrations, deploy, Worker secrets, a fresh Stripe webhook. `SITE_URL` for a custom domain. `--preview` updates the PR preview Worker |
| `ci.yml` | `.github/workflows/` | Verify on PRs, a preview link per PR (`ci.yml` comments say how `env.preview` must look); deploy from `main` with the `production` environment |
| `tests/wrangler-config.test.ts` | `tests/unit/` | `wrangler.jsonc` stays plain JSON, and `env.preview` repeats every binding (wrangler envs inherit none) |
| `tests/shop.spec.ts` | `tests/e2e/` | Signed fake webhooks against `wrangler dev`, order validation, and real sessions against stripe-mock |
| `playwright.config.ts` | project root | Starts `wrangler dev` with the test webhook secret, plus the stripe-mock vars when `STRIPE_MOCK` is set |

**What the project still adds:**

- the order page;
- the `/danke` page;
- the legal pages and PDFs (`legal-de.md`);
- the Widerrufsbutton flow;
- the Sendcloud call;
- an admin orders view, with the fulfilment retry button.

All of these are built in the project's design. Replace the placeholders `example-mug`,
`Beispielshop` and `example.de` in the same PR.

Before launch, add a Cloudflare rate-limiting rule on `/api/checkout*` in the zone's
Security → WAF settings. Without it, anyone can loop the endpoint, filling D1 and burning the
Stripe API rate limit.

On `*.workers.dev`, every Worker of the account is same-site (`workers.dev` is on the Public
Suffix List, the account's subdomain is not; from duo-test's security review), so SameSite cookies don't stop a sibling Worker from posting to the shop.
Add a check to every non-GET API route except the Stripe webhook (Stripe sends no `Origin`; its
signature guards it): `Origin` (or `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`) must match `SITE_URL`, else
refuse. On a custom domain this is a backstop rather than the only guard.

## Wiring

- `wrangler.jsonc` needs:
  - `"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]`
  - a D1 binding `DB`
  - `migrations_dir` pointing at the migrations
  - an `env.preview` block for PR previews, repeating every binding (`ci.yml` comments show it;
    `tests/wrangler-config.test.ts` checks it). Keep the file plain JSON, no comments.
- `package.json` needs `"deploy": "node scripts/deploy.mjs"` and a `verify` script that runs
  typecheck, unit tests, build and the e2e tests.
- `wrangler.jsonc` `vars`: `SITE_URL` is the canonical `https://` address. Links and email
  attachments use it instead of whatever host a request came in on.
- `playwright.config.ts` from the templates starts the real runtime with a test-only webhook
  secret. CI runs stripe-mock as a service (`ci.yml`). Locally:

  ```bash
  docker run -p 12111:12111 stripe/stripe-mock
  STRIPE_MOCK=http://127.0.0.1:12111 npx playwright test
  ```

- In cloud threads, launch Playwright's browser with `executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium'`.
  The webhook tests only use `request`, so they need no browser.
- To try a real test payment locally, on yskills' PC: put test keys in `.dev.vars`, then run
  `stripe listen --forward-to 127.0.0.1:8787/api/stripe/webhook`. It prints a `whsec_…` for
  `.dev.vars`. Test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`; 3-D Secure `4000 0027 6000 3184`.

## Variants

**Digital product, one-off** (duo-test pattern):

- Requires login. Use the user id as `client_reference_id`.
- Use a `purchases` table with a unique `stripe_session_id` instead of `orders`.
- No address or shipping.
- Before the button, a required checkbox: "Ich stimme zu, dass ihr vor Ablauf der Widerrufsfrist
  mit der Ausführung beginnt, und weiß, dass ich dadurch mein Widerrufsrecht verliere"
  (§ 356 Abs. 5 BGB).
  - The endpoint rejects the request without it and stores the consent in the session metadata.
  - The confirmation email repeats it. The waiver only counts once that email is sent, so it is
    part of the recipe, not optional: send it whenever `confirmation_sent_at` is NULL (webhook
    retry or return page), not only on the first insert, with a Resend idempotency key.
- Refuse a second purchase of the same one-off product (409), and accept a session only when
  `mode`, `amount_total`, `currency` and the product all match.
- **Live-key lock:** checkout refuses a `sk_live_`/`rk_live_` key until the seller details in
  `shared/business.ts` (name, street, city, email, phone) are filled and `RESEND_API_KEY` and
  `MAIL_FROM` exist. Keep it a pure, unit-tested function in `shared/checkout.ts`; it suits every
  project.

**Subscription (Billing):**

Not yet run on Workers; the first subscription project proves it and updates this section.

- **Catalog:** one Product per plan (Starter, Pro…), monthly and yearly as two Prices of that
  Product. Give every Price a `lookup_key` and find it by that key, so sandbox and live need no
  id changes.
- **Checkout:** `mode: 'subscription'` with the user's Stripe Customer (`customer`), never
  `payment_method_types`. The order button rules above still apply.
- **The [Better Auth Stripe plugin](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/stripe)** does the
  customer, checkout, portal and webhook parts when the app uses Better Auth. As of 1.7.7 its
  peer range is `stripe` ^18 to ^22, so pin `stripe@22` in that project (check `recheck.md`).
- **Webhook events** (add to the deploy script's `WEBHOOK_EVENTS`): `checkout.session.completed`,
  `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`,
  `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`. They are not
  optional: renewals, failed payments and cancellations only arrive this way.
  - Access follows the stored subscription `status` (`active`, `trialing`), not the return page.
  - Map each event to the user through its Stripe customer or subscription id, stored in our
    DB. Metadata is a fallback only.
  - Payment retries and failed-payment emails: turn on Smart Retries and the customer emails in
    the Dashboard (Billing → Revenue recovery) instead of coding them.
- **Customer Portal** for cancelling, plan changes and card updates. Configure it once in the
  Dashboard (Settings → Billing → Customer portal). Add a Kündigungsbutton (`legal-de.md`).
- **Restricted key** additionally needs Customers Write, Prices Read, Subscriptions Read and
  Customer portal Write.

**Selling across the EU above the VAT threshold, digital only:** Stripe Managed Payments.
Stripe becomes the seller, so it works through Checkout only. Check `recheck.md` first.

## Gotchas

- **Raw body.** `readRawBody` must see the exact bytes; any JSON parsing before it breaks the
  signature.
- **Fulfil on `payment_status === 'paid'`, never on the `completed` event alone.** SEPA
  completes unpaid and pays days later.
- **Keep the webhook fast:** do the slow work after the 2xx with `event.waitUntil`. Stripe
  retries for up to 3 days.
- **Stripe sends events more than once and out of order.** Every write is guarded by the state
  it expects.
- **The webhook secret differs between sandbox and live.** `deploy.mjs` creates a fresh endpoint
  on every deploy:
  - first the new endpoint, then its secret, then the old endpoint is deleted;
  - its `api_version` is pinned to the SDK's.

  So switching keys, adding events or a disabled endpoint never needs a hand fix.
- **One Stripe account serves several projects.**
  - Every endpoint gets every account event, so handlers ignore sessions and charges they
    don't know. `markOrderPaid` requires the order's own session id, because a Payment Link
    can carry any `client_reference_id`.
  - Refunds and disputes that match nothing are logged, not failed.
- **Sandbox orders stay in the live D1.** `livemode` marks them; delete them at go-live
  (`DELETE FROM orders WHERE livemode = 0 OR livemode IS NULL`).
- **`automatic_tax` silently collects nothing** until Tax settings have a head office address
  and an active registration for the buyer's country; there is no error. Before turning it on,
  check both in the sandbox, run a test Tax Calculation and make sure `taxability_reason` is not
  `not_collecting`. Product tax codes come from Stripe's [tax code list](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes);
  never guess one, let yskills (or the Steuerberater) confirm it.
- **A 100% promotion code** completes with `payment_status: 'no_payment_required'`. Fulfil on
  that too if the project offers such codes; otherwise leave promotion codes off.
- **Never put a price in a request body or in metadata the client can influence.**
- **Rate-limit checkout, confirm and withdrawal** with the Workers rate-limit binding
  (`ratelimits` in `wrangler.jsonc`, keyed on `cf-connecting-ip`). It works in `wrangler dev`
  too.
- **Legal texts live in one shared TS module**, so the pages and the confirmation email can't
  drift apart.
