# Full-size figure pipeline

Summary of company-xy `tools/vrm/` (the source of truth: its README and `characters/mira/HANDOFF.md`).
Read those before changing a script; this page says what exists and why.

## Tools

Headless Blender through `bpy` 5.2.2 on python3.13 plus the VRM add-on 4.7.2 (extensions.blender.org,
installed into `user_default`). Builds run with `PATH=<dir where python3 is python3.13>:$PATH`.
No GPU in cloud threads: renders are Cycles CPU. In Cycles stills, pure white is the background
showing through, not shading.

| Script | Does |
|---|---|
| `assemble.py <build dir> <id> <out.blend>` | one scene per figure: intact body, `Under_*` and `Wear_*`/`Cloth_*` layers on one armature, Mask modifiers, `Outfit`/`Kleidung` switches |
| `dress.py <in.vrm> <out.vrm> '<layers>'` | refits library garments to a VRoid body, re-skins them to her bones, hides covered skin, toon pass |
| `fabric.py` | weave per cloth type, turned hems with stitching, darker folds, varied roughness |
| `face.py` | expression mixes (`EXPRESSIONS`), face normals from a head ellipsoid, blush |
| `look.py`, `shots.py` | studio material and light rig; stills (3/4, front, back, face) |
| `dance.py <figure.vrm> <out.json>` | 1 s loop from Quaternius `Dance_Loop`, retargeted, spring bones baked |
| `handles.py`, `live_view.py` | IK drag handles for yskills; a visible Blender that reloads the live folder |
| `check_layers.py` | must print ok: outfits switch cleanly, nothing tears in a wide stance, arms up, crouch |
| `chibi_koban.py` | the chibi ([chibi-roadmap.md](chibi-roadmap.md)) |
| `fetch-library.sh`, `make_library.py`, `inspect_glb.py`, `sheet.mjs` | library fetch, index, header check, contact sheet |

## Layer rule (every main figure)

1. **Body:** one complete, intact skin mesh. Nothing painted on, no faces deleted. Smooth,
   non-explicit base under the underwear.
2. **Underwear:** its own objects (`Under_*`, stockings as real meshes) on the same armature.
3. **Outfits:** their own objects on top.
4. **Clipping:** one `Mask` modifier per outfit layer on the body hides only the skin that garment
   covers (two-sided normal-line ray test, eroded one ring); the last centimetre under a hem stays
   so a standing-off waistband shows skin, not the inside of the skirt.
5. **Switches:** armature properties drive garment visibility and masks with simple-expression
   drivers (work with Auto Run off). Underwear has no off switch in delivered files.

NPCs may be one combined mesh where that is standard game practice. The pro garment stack (studied
on Blender Studio rigs and the study file): `Armature → CorrectiveSmooth → (Surface Deform +
Shrinkwrap for tight fits) → Mask → Subdivision last`. Tight outfits get 4 to 6 corrective shape
keys (chest forward, shoulders down, thigh forward); VRM has no drivers, so the game sets them from
bone angles.

## Straps and tight cloth

Cut straps, tops and briefs **out of the body surface**: duplicate, two `bisect_plane` cuts at ±
width/2, delete the rest, Solidify 2.5 mm, Subdivision 1. Sell tightness with a 1.8 mm skin indent
under the strap and a 0.6 mm bulge beside it, plus a contact-shadow line in the texture. Where real
fabric bridges a hollow (cleavage), smooth a local vertex group ~10 iterations and Shrinkwrap
`OUTSIDE_SURFACE`; smoothing the whole piece breaks open edges.

## Faces

Persona 5 keeps 3D faces simple and adds 2D overlays; Genshin/HSR/ZZZ mix brow/eye/mouth part keys
and use a face SDF shadow map. Ours: VRoid `BRW_`/`EYE_`/`MTH_` part mixes (never only the `ALL_`
presets), ellipsoid face normals, blush layer, 2D stickers for comedy.

| Game event | Expression |
|---|---|
| Greeting | Freude 0.6, wave, head tilt |
| Praise | Freude + Roete, small hop |
| Task done | Stolz, nod |
| Task failed | Traurig, sweat-drop sticker |
| Money earned | Freude + sparkle eyes, cheer |
| Idle | her default mood, blink every 2 to 6 s, look-at follows the cursor |
| Teased | Ueberrascht, then Wuetend 0.4 + Roete |
| Goodbye | Zwinkern, wave |

Still missing for all figures: `><` eyes, pout, tears, the face SDF shadow in MToon.

## Physics and motion

- Game: VRM spring bones on bust, hair and skirt with sphere colliders (head, chest, hips, thighs);
  colliders unscaled, small hit radius. Bust carries 60 % of the upper chest's motion (`CARRY`) and
  has its settled ~30° sag removed (`unsag`), or lively clips swing it through ~64°.
- Blender: jiggle by small pinned cloth proxies plus an inflated collision cage, so arms and
  clothes never sink in. Wiggle 2 (GPL add-on) to find spring values.
- Moves are shared clips (VRMA, Quaternius UAL), crossfade 0.2 to 0.3 s; arms kept outside the
  torso and bust by measuring the skinned meshes.

## Look (what yskills' reference pictures share)

Dark world (strength ~0.2), warm soft key, low fill, **strong cool rim** from behind; AgX view
transform. Skin: subsurface 1.0 (radius about 1 / 0.45 / 0.25), dual specular lobes, light coat
(0.2) for the glossy sheen, AO multiplied into colour. Cloth: cotton roughness ~0.87 with a little
sheen, satin ~0.26, translucency on thin fabric, weave normal/bump maps, lace as an alpha shell.
In three.js: `MeshPhysicalMaterial` sheen 0.5 to 1 for satin, `AgXToneMapping`, SSAO/N8AO for
contact shadow under straps and bust. Full size target ≤100k triangles after Subdivision 1.

## Quality bar (each line already reached yskills once)

- Start from the best finished free base, never from scratch; copy techniques, never files.
- Keep the base's proportions; style with smooth shape keys, hands, feet and joints untouched.
- Layers, not paint; never delete body faces.
- Garment weights come from the body, each leg piece locked to its own leg (boots once webbed
  between the feet), skirts smoothed to swing as one piece. `check_layers.py` ok.
- No holes at hems; real footwear with soles on the floor.
- Cloth reads as its material (satin glides, denim has twill, leather grain).
- Elegant means long, fitted, smooth, with a slit, not a boxy mini.
- Faces read at a glance; brows visible over bangs.
- Render, look at every frame as an AAA character artist would, fix, then show; name what is weak.
- Content line: lingerie at most; the body under underwear is smooth and non-explicit.
