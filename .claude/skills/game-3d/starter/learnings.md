# Learnings digest (3D figures and games)

From Company XY's figure work, 2026-10-06 to 10-08: the HQ office animals, ten figures and Mira
(versions v2 to v12). Kept: what a new project would otherwise relearn. Dropped: per-version
history, one-off bug hunts, research that led nowhere. Add a line only when it recurs; newest last
in each section.

## How yskills judges 3D work

- **Test before showing.** Every picture was rendered and looked at frame by frame first; untested
  IK handles once tore Mira's hands off on yskills' screen. Every reply names what is still weak.
- **Start from the best finished work, never from scratch.** Find the best free model and the
  workflow its makers used, then restyle. Hand-tuned code on a weak base never reached the bar.
- The bar is AAA character art (Baldur's Gate level materials, BlobCG-smooth anime 3D), cute
  cartoon for chibis and animals (Animal Crossing, TFT). "Looks AI" or "broken" means start over
  from a better base, not tweak.
- Picture sets go in this order: inspiration, bare model in underwear, outfits, chibi. Compare
  variants side by side (base vs styled); yskills answers "more" or "ok".
- One plan, one instruction: settle tool choices between threads before yskills gets a manual
  step. yskills is not a confident Blender user: pose figures for them and give simple drag
  handles (hips, hands, feet).
- Content line, held: adult figures, lingerie and swimwear at most; no nudity, no anatomical detail,
  not even under clothes; underwear cannot be switched off in delivered files.
- No paid assets for now; free library plus own work. Never tell yskills we can't build 3D models.

## Decisions (reuse unless a game has a reason not to)

- **Format VRM** (VRM 0 for VRoid bases): runs in three.js, Unity (UniVRM) and Godot (godot-vrm),
  so an engine change later needs no rebuild. Engine three.js (`../SKILL.md` §1); Godot is the free
  path if a game outgrows the browser.
- **Figures are recipes built headless**: recipe JSON → Blender script → VRM, in cloud threads.
  No headless anime character builder exists (VRoid Studio has no API, Ready Player Me shut down
  2026-01-31, Character Creator has no glTF export), so ours is base + library + assembly script.
- **Two outputs per figure**: full size and chibi; a decimated crowd LOD later.
- **Layers like pro character files**: intact body, underwear objects, outfit objects, one
  armature, Mask modifiers for clipping ([figures.md](figures.md)).
- **Moves are shared files** (VRMA, Quaternius UAL CC0); Mixamo only with yskills' Adobe account.
- **Library outside git** (635 MB) with a pinned, hashed index; binaries never in the repo.
- If quality must jump later, the step up is one paid pro base with a fitted-outfit market (BOOTH
  VRChat bases, about 60 to 120 € for a figure plus outfits): yskills buys, everything else stays.

## Settings that worked

- Blender: `bpy` 5.2.2 on python3.13, VRM add-on 4.7.2, Cycles CPU (no EGL/GPU in the cloud),
  AgX. Subdivision is always the last modifier; low cage (2k to 10k verts) for crisp silhouettes.
- Light: dark world ~0.2, warm key, low fill, strong cool rim from behind; in three.js add
  `AgXToneMapping` and SSAO/N8AO. Pastel scenes: tone mapping off, hex colours through
  `convertSRGBToLinear()` under sRGB output.
- MToon chibi and skin values: [chibi-roadmap.md](chibi-roadmap.md) §6. Full-size skin: warm shade
  (skin × (0.95, 0.72, 0.68)), soft toony 0.3 to 0.5, faint skin-tone rim.
- Springs: `vrm.update(delta)` in seconds, delta clamped to 50 ms, colliders unscaled; bust
  `CARRY` 0.6 and `unsag`; finger curl 0.35 in the dance.
- Walkers: A* over a floor grid from the furniture boxes, give way instead of overlap, stride
  follows distance walked, ease in and out at about 1 m/s.

## Pitfalls (each one cost a round)

- Scaling bones or limbs to restyle (chibi v4-v7) looks broken; use shape keys with soft falloff.
- Clothes painted on the skin or body faces deleted: rejected; layers only.
- Garment edges from face selection come out stair-stepped; cut with `bisect_plane`.
- Garment weights copied loosely let a leg piece follow the other leg (boots webbed between the
  feet); lock each leg piece to its own side, cut bridges between the legs.
- Straps modelled as ribbons float over hollows; cut them from the body surface.
- Blender's Auto IK tears VRoid limbs (bones unconnected); use explicit IK handles. Blender 5
  hides bones with `PoseBone.hide`.
- VRM 0 models face +z: x and z bone rotations mirror (flipped arms, flat fingers).
- MToon matcap lit hair in white stripes; screen-space outlines in three-vrm 1.0.10 still thin with
  distance, so use world mode.
- A running build rewrites its output: copy a file out before baking from it.
- The project share re-encodes PNGs on write: pin images by upstream hash, check only presence.
- Base64 grows a third: size upload caps for that. Cloud Chromium has no H.264: test video as WebM.
- Login sites (BOOTH, VRoid Hub, Sketchfab) and adult-gated downloads can't be automated, and
  Claude Code's safety check blocks some; never work around it, ask yskills to download.
- Never give yskills Blender MCP setup steps; keep Blender's Auto Run Python Scripts off and never
  auto-allow run-code.
- Load every model in a real browser scene with a sample file before review; Blender stills
  don't show three-vrm's outline, spring or shading bugs.
